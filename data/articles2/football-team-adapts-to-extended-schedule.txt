The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) has stated that football teams are allowed to play eight games in nine weeks. However, this year Andover was able to play an endowment game, an extra match to earn money for the school and the MIAA that is not considered for the team’s seeding in the state tournament.

This extended season is a one-year occurrence, due to calendar changes. Labor Day fell earlier than usual, on September 2, and Thanksgiving later, on November 28. This allows for an extra weekend in the qualifying period for the state tournament, granting teams extra days they wouldn’t have during a normal season. For Andover, that culminated in an extra game. Football began on August 16, similarly to other fall sports, which started on August 19.

“[The extended season] only affects the teams positively. We are really able to get an extra scrimmage with a lot of excitement,” head coach Ernest “EJ” Perry said. “The team dynamic is also impacted positively with the introduction of an endowment game. We are able to [put] more players in a game situation at the beginning of the year to look at who is doing a good job and who is ready for [our first regular season game.]”

Perry also recognized the team captains—Connor Acheson, William Dever, and Dominic Papa—for showing great leadership and work ethic throughout the preseason, highlighting the impact they had for just showing up.

“I think it’s also really helpful for team morale and team chemistry,” said Dever. “In addition to having an extra week, we also start before any other sport, so [although it’s]… a little tougher physically, you get to create [more] chemistry with your teammates… [The endowment game] was nice to prepare for our actual schedule though, which started on September 13.”

Although the Warriors lost the endowment game against Pinkerton Academy from New Hampshire on September 6, the experience still had benefits. The flexibility of a low-stakes game allowed people who would not normally get much playing time to showcase their skills. It also gave the team an opportunity to run plays against a real opponent, which will be vital for the rest of the season.

“[The team has] played [endowment games against] teams out of state before,” Perry said. “[I]t’s sort of a disadvantage playing a team from Florida or even New Hampshire because [New Hampshire’s] season starts a week earlier and Florida has already played a game. Our season always runs from August 16 to Thanksgiving. Preparing for another game is not really a problem except… we don’t have as many practices [beforehand.]”
