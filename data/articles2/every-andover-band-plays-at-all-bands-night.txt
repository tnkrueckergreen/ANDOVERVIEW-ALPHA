Andover High School hosted All Bands Night on March 28, and every Andover public school band got a chance to perform at the Collins Center.

All Bands Night is an annual concert where public schools in Andover get to have their bands perform a selection from their repertoire. It’s divided into two concerts: One for elementary school and part of middle school, and one for the other part of middle school and high school. Audience members are filtered out in the middle in order to allow enough space for all of the parents of each group. This year the concert spanned two and a half hours, giving every band ensemble a chance to perform at least one song, something that hasn’t consistently been true in years prior.

Senior and saxophonist Alex You said, “It’s an event where the high schoolers get to see their growth as musicians compared to where we came from.”

Not everyone had an experience reflective of the atmosphere of positivity surrounding the event. One senior and trombonist Enrico Panzica said, “It was the [worst] All Bands Night I’ve ever been to. I [messed] up in every single performance, and everyone else did too.”

Other students have mentioned that some call times were pretty intense, effectively requiring students to be at the building from after school to the end of the event at around 9:30.
