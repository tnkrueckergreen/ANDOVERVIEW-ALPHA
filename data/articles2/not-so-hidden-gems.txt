After the final bell, many Andover High School students only have one thing in mind. Homework? No—the perfect after-school snack. From cozy ice cream spots to vibrant Mexican restaurants, the surrounding area’s hotspots offer various choices for teens and young adults. In this guide, you’ll be taken on a tour of three of some AHS students’ favorite food spots, whether they are the tastiest, the coziest, or just have the best vibe. Who knows? These places may become your favorite spots to recharge and refuel after school.

## Mexica Burrito Grill

Across the border and into Tewksbury lies a restaurant akin to Chipotle, but to many, it’s even better. About a 15 to 20 minute drive from AHS, Mexica is a vibrant, medium-sized restaurant bursting with Mexican culture and cuisine. The walls are adorned with the most vibrant of colors,  and colorful and intricately cut paper picados hang from the ceiling, transporting you straight to Mexico. The lively music and warm lighting create a cozy and comfortable atmosphere that invites customers to stay longer, even when the restaurant is bustling with activity.

The ambiance is best described as “[giving] off authentic Mexican restaurant,” described senior Zoie Zeng. With this, late nights at Mexica often find a long line of people, oftentimes leading outside of the restaurant and almost wrapping around the sidewalk, especially Monday nights.

The reason? The five-dollar burrito deal.

On Monday, any burrito made with chicken, carnitas, or just veggies is only five dollars. These rushes heavily influence the atmosphere in Mexica than on any other day. According to senior Ian Chiang, it’s “more hectic” during this deal, and it makes the restaurant more of a grab-and-go rather than a sit-and-enjoy.

Despite the chaos, Mexica’s charm lies in the attention to detail in their food and bold flavors. Each bite is a reminder of the restaurant’s commitment to authentic taste—and that is what keeps customers coming back, even outside of the famed Monday burrito nights.

## Chipotle

“Let’s go to Chipotle” may be a sentence you have heard in your life, maybe too often. Whether it be after a sports game or an especially tough school day, Chipotle has been proven to be the go-to for most AHS students.

The sleek, modern, and minimalistic interior is quite the contrast from Mexica. There is little to no authentic Mexican “vibe” seen in Chipotle. Despite this, it is almost never void of customers sitting and eating their meals.

For students and young adults looking for quick and customizable meals, Chipotle’s “build-your-own” system seems to be unmatched. From burrito bowls to tacos to salads and protein bowls, there are an infinite number of possibilities when it comes to Chipotle.

It’s not only appealing to the younger generation, but also to those with dietary restrictions. Senior and vegetarian Samyak Jain appreciates the accommodations that are seen in the Chipotle menu. With the addition of “sofritas”—a plant-based protein substitute—to his meal, he is now able to get protein. “[Before I knew they had sofritas, I usually had to get [bowls] without any protein, but now I can get in with the protein, which is good,” he said.

There’s no doubt that this restaurant will stand the test of time with its accessibility, efficiency, and ability to cater to every person.

## The Cookie Monstah

After a filling meal from Chipotle or its Mediterranean rival on the other side of the plaza, Cava, you may find yourself in the mood for dessert. Look no further than The Cookie Monstah. While expertly evading copyright infringement of a certain *Sesame Street* character, The Cookie Monstah combines some of people’s favorite desserts in one store: cookies and ice cream.

As you walk in, your nose is immediately filled with the smell of freshly baked cookies, and your ears are filled with the murmurs of teens, children, and young adults enjoying their day out. Once you step in, there is also a chorus of “Hello” and “Welcome In,” and basically, every customer interaction is handled quickly. Immediately, the atmosphere is warm and inviting with the playful cookie decor and bright, cheerful colors.

“It’s a good meet-up spot,” said junior Jordan Shirley, who loves going with her friends after a game, or just after some Chipotle. “A lot of us will get it and then just go to our cars to eat.”

On the contrary, junior Kate Price usually enjoys her treats inside the store: “There’s a great environment there, and it smells really good in there.”

If your mood wasn’t instantly lifted before, taking a look at the menu will. It gives you a plethora of options. Want just cookies? Just ice cream? A cookie ice cream sandwich? An ice cream with a cookie on the side? There are almost no limits to the options available at Cookie.

“I get either an Oreo cookie or a Milky Way ice cream, and I put it together sometimes [as a sandwich],” said Shirley. Price and her friends “get a lot of joy from the [Cookie] Quakes,” which are shakes that mix any ice cream with any type of cookie.

All these features showcase why The Cookie Monstah is quite popular for students as it serves as a place to wind down and enjoy your desert.

From Chipotle’s savory build-your-own meals to The Cookie Monstah’s sugary creations, these local favorites provide more than just food—they offer a place to unwind, share moments, and create memories. Whether you’re craving hearty comfort or a playful treat, these spots deliver something special for everyone.
