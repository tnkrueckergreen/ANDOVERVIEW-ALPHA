In past years, the requirement for Digital Learning was grouped with Fine Arts as a 1.5 credit graduation requirement. This meant if someone took all art courses, they wouldn’t have to take any digital learning courses. The School Committee decided last year that it would be better to have these classes separated from then on so that students could experiment in both departments.

“We want kids to be exposed to the arts,” Shereen Rancourt, the Executive Director of Secondary Instruction said, “and also be exposed to things like business and computer design, so that’s why it’s different for the Class of 2028 and beyond.”

In the Andover High School Program of Studies, courses grouped under Digital Learning consist of Business, Web and Game Design, Film and Video Production, Broadcast Journalism, and the recently added AP Economics class. However, some Digital Learning classes are grouped under multiple departments, so they may be found elsewhere. For example, Computer Science classes count as a Math credit *or* a Digital Learning credit.

“If you need it for one or the other, you kind of use it where you need it,” Rancourt said.

Although for some students taking the courses may just mean fulfilling a requirement, program coordinators and teachers emphasized its importance beyond high school.

“The decision… also came from some of our program coordinators who were interested in giving more options to students,” Assistant Superintendent Julie Riley said, “[to] test out things they were interested in before… applying to colleges, so people have more of an understanding of what they may want to go into.”

Marianne Bezaire, a technology teacher, explained how Digital Learning is an important life skill to have in this world.

“Just like communication in general in math, I think digital literacy is important…,” Bezaire stated, “Not everyone needs to necessarily be learning the intricacies of Java… but I think it’s great if they can understand some of the concepts of logic and design.”
