Many people know the classic story *101 Dalmatians*, which follows two dalmatians and their adventure to get their puppies back from the movie’s antagonist, Cruella DeVille. However, the story doesn’t provide much of a backstory for its main villain. In May of 2021, Disney released an action-packed PG-13 comedy/crime movie titled *Cruella*, which follows Cruella as the main character. We find out that Cruella was an orphan, and her love for fashion is what powers her through the events of the movie. *Cruella* focuses on Cruella’s life before the events of *101 Dalmatians*, and features Emma Stone (Cruella), Emma Thompson (Baroness), and Joel Fry (Jasper). From gripping drama to unexpected twists, this movie has it all. You will be on the edge of your seat as there is never a boring moment in *Cruella*.

Cruella is now streaming exclusively on Disney+.
