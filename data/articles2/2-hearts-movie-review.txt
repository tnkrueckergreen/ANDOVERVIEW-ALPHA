If you opened up TikTok anytime this summer, you must have seen the rage about “2 Hearts.” Featuring Jacob Elordi, Tiera Skovbye, Adan Canto, and Radha Mitchel, the 2020 drama is based on a true story. The storyline follows two love stories between Christopher (Jacob Elordi) and Sam (Tiera Skovbye), who are both students at Loyola University, as well as Jorge (Adan Canto), a Cuban exile, and Leslie (Radha Mitchell), a flight attendant. With an unpredictable ending, the story descends from the promise of lasting love to sacrifice. It is a great movie to watch if you are in the mood for something that will surely leave you in tears.

“2 Hearts” is currently streaming on Netflix.
