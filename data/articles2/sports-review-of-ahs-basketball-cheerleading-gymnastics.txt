As the cold weather descends upon Massachusetts, winter sports have begun. Tryouts began on Monday, November 29th and teams have been finalized for the winter season. For many, it is the first time back in their sport after a long break due to COVID. However, restrictions for safe playing have changed the environment and left players to adjust to these new rules for all the winter sports. Winter sports at AHS include boys basketball, girls basketball, cheering, gymnastics, boys hockey, girls hockey, indoor track, skiing, boys swim and dive, and wrestling.

### Girls Basketball

The Lady Warriors have flourished as a team over the past four years, making it to the state championship in 2019, and are hoping to reach that milestone once again this year. “We would like to win another state championship on the court, dominate in the classroom and make sure that we give back to our school and town community,” said Alan Hibino, the team’s coach and Andover High School math teacher.

The past season was different compared to the rest. With COVID in its full effect, players were forced to shift their perception of the normal and adapt to playing in COVID-safe ways. “Last year was different from the past as our season was cut short and we also were not allowed to play in the state tournament,” stated senior captain Morgan Shirley. Now, entering year two of COVID, the players will “still have to wear masks on the court,” said Hibino, “which is certainly a challenge.” Yet, “we also get to have fans this year,” said captain Hailey Doherty, a positive change.

For this basketball team, “the biggest challenges are getting caught up in the immediate outcome when we have short-term and long-term goals that we want to achieve,” said Hibino. An important part of the whole learning experience is accepting the setbacks that come in the path of the ultimate destination. “Mistakes are part of the learning process. Once they have served their purpose, [the team] wants to make sure they have learned from them and do not repeat them in the future,” said Hibino.

“Our main goal this year is to work together as a big family,” said senior captain Tess Gobiel. “We have already started with a solid foundation so I think it will only go up from here.” The whole aspect of playing together as a family has been a constant thread throughout this team over the years, and the athletes hope to continue that in the future.

### Boys Basketball

Hoping to make it to the state championship this year, the boys basketball team has been putting many hours into this season. “Last year, we were undefeated going into the league championship, and we lost to Central Catholic by one point,” recalled longtime coach David Fazio, also known as coach Faz. “We are going to use that loss as our motivator [this season so] we can maybe not lose our last game this year.”

The team had a great group of talent last year, and Faz believes that will carry right into this season as well. Not only is the team full of talent, but they all share a special bond, a piece that Faz believes is extremely important. “The best part for me is the camaraderie in the relationships I have with these guys,” stated Faz. “It ends up being a lifelong relationship, where I see them go from young men to mature adults to fathers to role models in the community.”

Senior captain Logan Satlow reiterated this relationship, adding that his favorite part is “just hanging out with teammates and getting to talk to kids [he] probably wouldn’t normally speak to.” The bonds created with each other off the court has a positive effect on the court and the team’s successes. Senior captain Richie Shahtanian expressed the same sentiments, “The best part of basketball is just the teamwork aspect of it. It’s not an individual sport and you have to rely on all five players on the court to play well.”

Since last season, the team faced various challenges due to COVID, such as having to wear masks. “It is really difficult from a standpoint of continuing your stamina because it is really hard to breathe with the masks on,” Faz added.

Yet, the team is optimistic that it will not be too much of an impediment, and they are instead focusing on their end goal. “We want to make a playoff run and win as many games as we can, and hopefully get Faz the title that he’s never gotten,” said Aidan Camman, senior captain. Shahtanian echoed this goal, while adding that he and other players from the class of 2022 also want “to have a great last year because it’s [their] senior year.”

Many of the younger players only played on the JV or freshman team due to COVID. “This will really be their first year truly playing a high school sport,” said Satlow. “They went from eighth grade to sophomore year, so having to merge everyone in and making sure everyone is together will be a big step.” The captains are optimistic that with the talent they are seeing, this will not come in the way of the team’s achievements. “That could be a challenge, but they are also really good underclassmen,” said Shahtanian.

The team is also encouraged by the prospect of having fans back at games. “We’re really looking forward to the Jungle being in our gymnasium creating havoc and creating chaos, dancing, and making a lively scene in the gym… that is such an advantage for us as we’re playing,” concluded Faz.

### Cheer

“Cheerleading is such an amazing sport, and I think oftentimes their hard work goes unnoticed,” said Katie Rex, who has been the AHS cheerleading coach for three years. “The girls do many things for school like attend games, volunteer, and pep rallies. At the same time, they are practicing four to five times per week and working on their competition routine.”

In the past year, the team made it to States in the fall and New Englands in the winter, which was a great accomplishment. Despite making it to both competitions, the team faced challenges due to COVID, as they “had to stay six feet apart and wear masks,” said Ashlyn Rose, senior captain. With time, the team has been able to adjust and find ways to perform their stunts and routines with the masks on.

“Cheer is very individual but also a team sport, so everyone has to work together,” stated Brooke Rose, senior captain. “Everyone has to give 100 percent because, if not, a stunt could fail and result in injuries, thereby defeating our progress.” Creating a successful stunt can take time and patience, but the end result always makes it worth it. With these values, the team hopes to reach their end goal of New Englands. Throughout the season, the girls all become one big family and this relationship brings out the “best part of the team, which is working as a whole to reach our goal,” said Taylor Henderson, senior captain.

For this season, the senior captains are excited to share their love for the sport with the rest of the team. “I’m excited to meet new girls who are trying out this year,” said Brooke, “I am also very excited for the games.”

This season holds a bittersweet place in the hearts of the three senior captains. They all started cheering around the same time in elementary school with a summer cheerleading camp, and have remained best friends ever since. “I’m looking forward to this being a great last season and spending it with my best friends,” Henderson concluded.

### Gymnastics

“My goal for the season is to showcase each gymnast’s talents, clean up their routines, and aim to beat their personal best scores to ultimately maximize our team score,” said Marlena Bresnick, head coach of Andover High School’s gymnastics team. This is Bresnick’s first year coaching the AHS team, but she has had lots of experience in the past coaching at Reading Gymnastics Academy and judging gymnastics for many years.

Bresnick spoke about the “athleticism, power, strength, and beauty” of this particular sport, adding that despite it being “mentally and physically challenging, the team motivates and encourages each other with each skill and routine.”

Amber Ferris, senior captain, who has been doing gymnastics for eight years, also spoke to the various mental challenges, stating that “the biggest challenges for [her] in gymnastics is being able to mentally push through skills on different events that [she] is afraid of,” adding that competing in front of judges can also be a bit nerve racking. The support of the team and the fans always helps her pull through.

Bresnick “can’t wait to see the team compete in person, looking forward to new routines, competing new skills, beating personal best scores, laughing about mistakes, and smiling because the girls did something great.”

Regardless of the successes, there were many challenges last year due to COVID. One specific challenge for this team is practice logistics. “We have to be creative with our workout space and efficient with our shortened time in the gym,” said Bresnick. Luckily, Legends and Reading Gymnastics has allowed Andover to use their facilities to practice.

Another setback that this team faces is that “there are definitely less gymnasts on the team this year,” reflected Ferris. Gymnastics, truly a team sport, could have seen a decrease in motivation due to this; however, there is a talented group of girls this year, and all the coaches and captains alike feel that they are in for huge successes. “It is the team score that counts and with that comes lots of cheering,” reflected Bresnick. “They encourage, scream, cheer, and celebrate each completed routine.”

Along with assistant coaches Sarah Muolo and Jimmy Tommachio, Bresnick “[feels] really honored to be asked to coach the team this year… and [looks] forward to an exciting year ahead.”
