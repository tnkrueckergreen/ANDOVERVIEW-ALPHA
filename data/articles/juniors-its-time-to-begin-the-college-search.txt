SCOIR, the new college search and preparation platform brought to the Andover High School sophomores and juniors during the 2020-2021 school year and the seniors the year prior, is a platform for students to make their college searching experience much easier. SCOIR allows you to do anything from keep track of applications to request a teacher’s letter of recommendation.

Anne-Marie Fortier, one of the AHS guidance counselors, talked about this program during an interview stating that “it’s far more user friendly” (SCOIR is the predecessor of Naviance) Juniors can use SCOIR for their college searching process and see what is out there for colleges and universities. “There’s a search function that allows students to select a number of fields that are important to them… size, location, major, any specific activities, athletics,” and more.

Another great feature the juniors can use is the populated information part of this program. “Once you find a college in SCOIR, we have populated information about other Andover students that have applied and who have either been admitted or denied based on the variable of test scores or GPA,” said Fortier. This allows students to see if their test scores and GPA qualify for the college they are looking for and helps them narrow down their choices for colleges. This makes the selection process (hopefully) a bit easier.

This program is also great for sophomores. Sophomores can use this to look at what they could possibly be interested in before going more in-depth in their junior and senior years. “There is a program acclimated with SCOIR that is related to career development… we are still putting some finishing touches on how we want to present that material,” said Fortier.

If you are still nervous about searching for college and don’t know where to start, here are some tips and tricks from our seniors to help you in this experience.

The college search can become very stressful when you don’t know where to start. “Recently, college searching has been making me really nervous,” said Mishaal Khan. She is a junior and started looking at colleges the summer before her junior year. “I’m excited, I know it is a new chapter in our lives and it is a chance for us to study and learn about something we are interested in as individuals.” Her enthusiasm is a great start. But let’s give some tips and tricks from two of our very own seniors, Sophia Yannalfo and Charles Hoffman!

Sophia Yannalfo was recently accepted into Northeastern University in Boston and Charles Hoffman has finished his college application process. Both Hoffman and Yannolfo were both very excited about the academic side of things which is very important. If a college doesn’t have what you are wishing to study, this can help narrow this list down.

“Utilize your guidance counselors, utilize your peers, especially if you are a sophomore or a junior that is starting to look at school,” Yannolfo said. People who have already been through the process can be a huge help, such as your older peers or even older siblings. Your guidance counselors also know a lot about you, so they can help you find the places that could match your interests.

An open mind is also incredibly important. “We didn’t know we were going to be in a global pandemic and that we would have to apply to colleges in the middle of [this],” she said. “Keep your options open because you might be set on one thing your freshman and sophomore year and then you end up changing your mind completely.”

Both Yannolfo and Fortier recommend communicating with your parents. “I think a conversation with your parents is probably the first thing to do. Even if you aren’t initially on the exact same page,”  Fortier said, adding that keeping your parents informed is important for the topics of expectations for each other. Financial aid might also be discussed and scholarships as well.

And the last general tip is good organization. “Start as early as the beginning of your junior year,” Yannolfo said. “Just kind of look at what you’ve done throughout high school so far… the whole organization factor is so so important.”

Hoffman agrees with this as well. “I definitely wish I worked on this more in the summer, because the time crunch right now is no joke!” he said.
