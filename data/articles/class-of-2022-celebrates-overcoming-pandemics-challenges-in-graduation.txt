For the first time since the pandemic started, the Andover High School class of 2022 had their graduation ceremony in the Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell, on June 6, 2022.

It has been three years since the last graduation ceremony was held in the Tsongas Center. In the past two years, graduations have taken place outside or virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For this year’s seniors, the pandemic started their sophomore year. Despite the difficulties endured by the class of 2022, speech makers praised the students’ character and achievements. “We have endured so much throughout our four years,” said senior Kijari Boyd in the welcome statement.

“You showed that masks may cover half our faces, but they cannot hide our smiles,” said superintendent Dr. Magda Parvey. “They cannot mask your pride.”

Principal Caitlin Brown praised the many achievements of the class of 2022, such as the successful girls’ field hockey team and the Seaperch robotics team. Brown also commended Abby Murnane for her commitment to joining the military after college.

“These are just a few of the achievements from the class of 2022, and they are incredible,” said Brown. “But what makes this class stand out is who they are, day-in and day-out.”

Parvey agreed. “You have grown into good citizens,” she told the class of 2022. “That alone says that you have gotten the true message of your education here.”

Parvey encouraged the graduating class to continue to embody the Golden Warrior principles they learned at AHS — kindness and mutual respect. When dealing with disagreeable people in life, Parvey reminded the students: “You are not responsible for how they act, you are responsible for how you act,” she reminded the students. Parvey’s message to the students was simple: continue to be kind and respectful.

The ceremony included the mention of an important substitute teacher: Francyne Fuller, who passed away this year. The senior class presented the distinguished citizen award to Fuller for her work as a hall monitor and substitute teacher at AHS. The award was presented to Fuller’s daughter by senior Michaela Sherlock. Sherlock described Fuller as “a beloved teacher and role model” who was “always finding humor in life.” She was honored by the senior class for her “kind nature and inspiring words” as a teacher.

Prior to the ceremony, the seniors gave advice to current underclassmen, reminding students to enjoy their time in high school to the fullest.

“Stop wishing you were older and live life in the present,” said Tyler Fabbri.

“Just enjoy the moments that you have,” advised Tristan Fabre. “And make sure you… know how to ask for help.”

“All will be well,” reassured Catherine Gorman.

While the class of 2022 was excited to graduate, they also reminisced on their time in high school.

Opening her speech, class essayist Kiara Karwowski said, “Pardon the interruption. Bus 24 students will be going home on Bus 30 today, after Bus 30 has completed its regular route,” mimicking the frequent announcements on changes in the bus schedule this year. This was met with many laughs from the audience. Karwowski also referenced cameras and mics “not working” during online learning last year.

“I wish I could go down to the vending machine just one more time,” said Karwowski.

“I’ll definitely miss my teachers, I really liked some of them. I’ll also miss my friends because they’re all going to different colleges,” said Carol Yu, another senior.

“I’ll really miss the community and the people,” said Jeff Connors.

In the closing remarks, Catherine Machold quoted the TV show *Friends*: “Welcome to the real world. It sucks, you’re gonna love it.”

After the remarks, overwhelming cheers erupted as seniors celebrated their final high school moments, throwing their caps in the air.
