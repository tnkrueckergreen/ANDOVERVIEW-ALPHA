The student-faculty basketball game is scheduled for April 3 during H-block and is being organized by the Sophomore Board led by Mary Testa.

Students can either sign up to watch through MyFlexLearning, or volunteer to play. The faculty team of 12 staff members is held secret until the day of the game. “Mr. Bledsoe [will be on] the mic,” Testa provided.

The student-faculty basketball game is an annual event organized by the class boards. The faculty team won last year’s game, but the playing field is level again this year. Testa predicts an exciting showdown and encourages students to join. “We expect a better turnout this year,” she added, referring to the students playing as well as the audience.
