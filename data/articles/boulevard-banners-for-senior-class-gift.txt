The Class of 2025 chose AHS Boulevard banners that will adorn light poles along the front driveway to the school as their graduation gift.

The banners will be installed within the next few months, most likely during the summer. The gift was decided on by the senior board, which proposed ideas for a class gift, and the graduation committee, with whom the board collaborated to make a final decision.

The graduation committee wanted a gift that adequately encapsulates the drive, hard work, passion, and enthusiasm of their class. They agreed on light pole banners to create a welcoming atmosphere for students and families arriving at the school, and to be a lasting reminder of the graduating class’s contribution.

“It’s a public, year-round way to leave a legacy,” said Assistant Principal Alicia Linsey.

The decision was made in the past two months through discussions with the graduation committee. Five design options for the banner were presented, and the seniors voted on their favorite design during the graduation rehearsal meeting on May 23.

“The graduation committee chose something to inspire future graduating classes and community members to lead and act with spirit and authenticity,” said senior Shreya Desai, who announced the gift at the graduation ceremony.

Past senior gifts have included outside tables for the cafeteria, benches in the foyer, and chairs and tables for the nook on the third floor.
